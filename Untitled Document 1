If by "idolatry" you mean icons then the church was filled with them

Correct me if I'm wrong but aren't the filthy Catholics the ones who tried to sell tickets to heaven?
Cat Enthusiast Merchant (S1AL) â€” Today at 3:05 AM

I mean I'd be pretty happy that the line of Peter was restored
Cat Enthusiast Merchant (S1AL) â€” Today at 3:09 AM
No he's Italian
MTGloreseeker â€” Today at 3:09 AM
Vile little satanist that you are
Cat Enthusiast Merchant (S1AL) â€” Today at 3:10 AM
His parents were Italian expatriates
KnifeWife, resident virgin â€” Today at 3:10 AM
You're literally not even a Christian
MTGloreseeker â€” Today at 3:10 AM
Yes! Yes! Worship your king, WifeKnife!
KnifeWife, resident virgin â€” Today at 3:10 AM
You clearly don't know anything about Catholic doctrine
(granted I don't know very much either)
Ritter â€” Today at 3:10 AM
And all this over a typo...
MTGloreseeker â€” Today at 3:10 AM
Bow down! Surely that will make Jesus happy!
KnifeWife, resident virgin â€” Today at 3:10 AM
But I think I know more cause I go to Catholic learning classes
KnifeWife, resident virgin â€” Today at 3:10 AM
Huh?
Cat Enthusiast Merchant (S1AL) â€” Today at 3:10 AM
No it's actually just loreseeker being retarded and people indulging his retardation

KnifeWife, resident virgin â€” Today at 3:11 AM
Oh lol
Cat Enthusiast Merchant (S1AL) â€” Today at 3:11 AM
It's like how we watch all you Germans vote for authoritarians and then nod along sympathetically when you bitch about them being authoritarians
LawyersPlayDota â€” Today at 3:11 AM
Which is why its not worth arguging. He doesn't know what he's talking about.
MTGloreseeker â€” Today at 3:11 AM
'all you germans'?
Make up your mind S1AL what ethnicity am I?
KnifeWife, resident virgin â€” Today at 3:11 AM
Bro you forgot that lore hates germans
MTGloreseeker â€” Today at 3:12 AM
Please forgive him
KnifeWife, resident virgin â€” Today at 3:12 AM
You're American. You're like a big mix
MTGloreseeker â€” Today at 3:12 AM
He has 2 brain cells

KnifeWife, resident virgin â€” Today at 3:12 AM
We're all a fucking mix
Cat Enthusiast Merchant (S1AL) â€” Today at 3:12 AM
See, this is what I mean when I say you can't read. The word "like" makes something into a simile. It's not about you.
KnifeWife, resident virgin â€” Today at 3:12 AM
I'm Irish Scottish Syrian jewish
MTGloreseeker â€” Today at 3:12 AM
You used the word 'you germans'
Implying I was german
You fucking
Cat Enthusiast Merchant (S1AL) â€” Today at 3:12 AM
That's a lot of pretending to be white
KnifeWife, resident virgin â€” Today at 3:13 AM
Lol
MTGloreseeker â€” Today at 3:13 AM
Oh god English really is your second language
KnifeWife, resident virgin â€” Today at 3:13 AM
I don't think syrians pretend
MTGloreseeker â€” Today at 3:13 AM
My condolences I thought I was talking to a human for a bit
Turns out I was conversing with some kind of European
Cat Enthusiast Merchant (S1AL) â€” Today at 3:13 AM
That implies no such thing you fucking island monkey
MTGloreseeker â€” Today at 3:13 AM
'you germans'
Cat Enthusiast Merchant (S1AL) â€” Today at 3:14 AM

Get fucked Europoor
Cat Enthusiast Merchant (S1AL) â€” Today at 3:14 AM
Who is a German
Yeah anyways
You're still retarded
MTGloreseeker â€” Today at 3:15 AM
You still haven't provided anything to back up your initial claim
Like, at all
"Show me where in the bible it's claimed to be metaphor"
You have yet to do so
I don't believe you can
Maybe @KnifeWife, resident virgin can
He seems to have actually read the bible (unlike you)
KnifeWife, resident virgin â€” Today at 3:16 AM
I've read a little bit
MTGloreseeker â€” Today at 3:16 AM
Wifeknife
Is there a part in the bible where Jesus, God, or any of the authors says the myth of Genesis is an allegory, metaphor, or something similar?
Tezzereddit â€” Today at 3:16 AM
The whole bible is metaphor, obviously
Except for Matthew
MTGloreseeker â€” Today at 3:17 AM
kek
Obviously Revalations is the only non-metaphor book
KnifeWife, resident virgin â€” Today at 3:17 AM
No but I sorta believe the mention that the original Hebrew word meant a lot of things
I dunno I'll have to look more
Cat Enthusiast Merchant (S1AL) â€” Today at 3:17 AM
That particular word is used a lot
KnifeWife, resident virgin â€” Today at 3:17 AM
But going off the book I have here idk it seems like it's just days
MTGloreseeker â€” Today at 3:17 AM
Fascinating get back to me when you get that answer
Cat Enthusiast Merchant (S1AL) â€” Today at 3:18 AM
Ranging from "day" to "nebulous span of time or period in history"
Much the same way you would say "back in my day" in English
Tezzereddit â€” Today at 3:18 AM
I sometimes forget how bad the interpretations have gotten
My family was always KJV only
MTGloreseeker â€” Today at 3:19 AM
Neat
KnifeWife, resident virgin â€” Today at 3:19 AM
I've also got a kvj
I should check that one too
Tezzereddit â€” Today at 3:20 AM
Loreseeker strikes me as a Catholic
Cat Enthusiast Merchant (S1AL) â€” Today at 3:20 AM
Endless irony, given that James was a Catholic
Tezzereddit â€” Today at 3:20 AM
Indeed
KnifeWife, resident virgin â€” Today at 3:20 AM
Really?
Cat Enthusiast Merchant (S1AL) â€” Today at 3:20 AM
Yeah
KnifeWife, resident virgin â€” Today at 3:20 AM
Then why is it the protestant bible now
Is it just cause it doesn't have the apocrypha?
Cat Enthusiast Merchant (S1AL) â€” Today at 3:20 AM
But the translators basically just swiped Tyndale's work anyways
Tezzereddit â€” Today at 3:20 AM
He was also very bad at interpreting scripture
MTGloreseeker â€” Today at 3:20 AM
I'm not a pedophile, I hate idolatry, and I believe that the bible, not some pseudo-king, is what should guide the faithful
Cat Enthusiast Merchant (S1AL) â€” Today at 3:21 AM
Because it was the first official English translation
And was the default English translation for a few hundred years
MTGloreseeker â€” Today at 3:21 AM
EG I literally could never be a C*tholic
KnifeWife, resident virgin â€” Today at 3:21 AM
Good thing I hate pedophiles and idolatry, and believe the bible should guide my actions
KnifeWife, resident virgin â€” Today at 3:21 AM
Ah ok
MTGloreseeker â€” Today at 3:21 AM
Then you're not Catholic
Simple as
KnifeWife, resident virgin â€” Today at 3:21 AM
No I am
MTGloreseeker â€” Today at 3:22 AM
Ok so that means at least one of those statements is a lie
You understand that, right?
KnifeWife, resident virgin â€” Today at 3:22 AM
If my little old grandma who has a bad hip so she can't drive came in, would you say she's a pedophile because she's catholic
KnifeWife, resident virgin â€” Today at 3:22 AM
No it doesn't mean that
Cat Enthusiast Merchant (S1AL) â€” Today at 3:22 AM
You realize that lore just wants to be an asshole, right?
MTGloreseeker â€” Today at 3:22 AM
:hmm:
Tezzereddit â€” Today at 3:22 AM
Catholics and reformers are just different kinds of wrong
Cat Enthusiast Merchant (S1AL) â€” Today at 3:22 AM
He has zero interest in argument beyond causing trouble

MTGloreseeker â€” Today at 3:22 AM
Still waiting for you to actually post evidence of your claim
MTGloreseeker â€” Today at 3:23 AM
I'd be very glad to just move on and do something else
KnifeWife, resident virgin â€” Today at 3:23 AM
You are literally trying to say that the biggest Christian church is entirely pedophiles and idolaters
That's clearly some shit stirring
MTGloreseeker â€” Today at 3:23 AM
"Hey S1AL thanks for either posting actual proof of your claim or backing down and admitting you were wrong"
That sentence would be so easy to type out
If only you did one of those things
Tezzereddit â€” Today at 3:23 AM
What are Saints and Mary worship if not idolatry
KnifeWife, resident virgin â€” Today at 3:24 AM
I don't worship either of them
And that's not the actual doctrine
MTGloreseeker â€” Today at 3:24 AM
It can be either/or
Tezzereddit â€” Today at 3:24 AM
Prayer is a form of worship
MTGloreseeker â€” Today at 3:24 AM
Bet your lovely granny is an idolator
...idolizer?
Idol worshipper
KnifeWife, resident virgin â€” Today at 3:24 AM
When asking the saints for intercession it's not worshipping them it's asking them to pray to God on your behalf, particularly in regards to the thing they're the patron saint of
Since they're saints and already in heaven they're probably closer to God iirc
I dunno I'm new to this 
LawyersPlayDota â€” Today at 3:25 AM
you're still trying to explain this to him?
MTGloreseeker â€” Today at 3:25 AM
I'll leave this here as an open offer to @Cat Enthusiast Merchant (S1AL) btw
Just to prove a point
KnifeWife, resident virgin â€” Today at 3:25 AM
Fine
Tezzereddit â€” Today at 3:25 AM
Putting someone between you and God is a bad idea
melf â€” Today at 3:26 AM
just asking for prayer isn't worship
but, bowing down is
KnifeWife, resident virgin â€” Today at 3:26 AM
Yeah
KnifeWife, resident virgin â€” Today at 3:26 AM
Well and you're also supposed to pray directly to God
You do both
MTGloreseeker â€” Today at 3:26 AM
You do one
Tezzereddit â€” Today at 3:26 AM
Redemption through deeds is pretty good though
KnifeWife, resident virgin â€” Today at 3:26 AM
You pray to God yourself, and then also ask others to pray for you 
It's like when you put in a prayer request at a church
melf â€” Today at 3:26 AM
ascribing divine attributes, like omniscience would also be a form of worship
KnifeWife, resident virgin â€” Today at 3:26 AM
I remember when lpd asked us to pray for his friends daughter
Cat Enthusiast Merchant (S1AL) â€” Today at 3:27 AM
Ok, let's just put a lid on this:

1) asking saints to pray for you is not worship
2) calling them intercessors is wrong and anti-biblical but otherwise irrelevant
KnifeWife, resident virgin â€” Today at 3:27 AM
It's basically the same thing as doing a prayer request at church, except you're requesting that somebody already in heaven do it 
Cat Enthusiast Merchant (S1AL) â€” Today at 3:27 AM
3) invocation and adoration of the saints is common practice in several present denominations
Tezzereddit â€” Today at 3:27 AM
Saints are dead so you're already doing witchcraft by attempting to communicate with them
MTGloreseeker â€” Today at 3:28 AM
Will you consider my offer?
KnifeWife, resident virgin â€” Today at 3:28 AM
Well no they're alive in heaven
They're actually eternally alive
Tezzereddit â€” Today at 3:28 AM
Attempting to coerce the favor of God through unnatural means is sorcery
KnifeWife, resident virgin â€” Today at 3:28 AM
It's not coercion tho
It's a request

Also
That's like saying ANY prayer is coercion of God
Tezzereddit â€” Today at 3:28 AM
Sure, summoning a demon is a request
KnifeWife, resident virgin â€” Today at 3:29 AM
You're asking Christ to forgive you
MTGloreseeker â€” Today at 3:29 AM
I'm curious how many stories of the Bibble involve god being coerced into doing something
Can't be too many, right?
Tezzereddit â€” Today at 3:29 AM
Quite a few
KnifeWife, resident virgin â€” Today at 3:29 AM
By your definition a regular prayer to God is sorcery
Tezzereddit â€” Today at 3:29 AM
Praying to God is prayer
KnifeWife, resident virgin â€” Today at 3:29 AM
Yeah
MTGloreseeker â€” Today at 3:29 AM
Alright gimme an example
Tezzereddit â€” Today at 3:29 AM
If your prayers consist of just asking for things you're fucking garbage
KnifeWife, resident virgin â€” Today at 3:29 AM
So trying to get others to pray for you is also just prayer
KnifeWife, resident virgin â€” Today at 3:30 AM
Well unless those things you're praying for are forgiveness
MTGloreseeker â€” Today at 3:30 AM
Hush angelfucker I wanna hear about how God got bamboozled
Tezzereddit â€” Today at 3:30 AM
Dude wrestling an angel, Job, David at least once, idk
KnifeWife, resident virgin â€” Today at 3:30 AM
You can pray to God for mercy
Tezzereddit â€” Today at 3:30 AM
There more examples of God coming around eventually
Cat Enthusiast Merchant (S1AL) â€” Today at 3:31 AM
Sodom and Gomorrah
Nineveh
KnifeWife, resident virgin â€” Today at 3:31 AM
Oh yeah
Cat Enthusiast Merchant (S1AL) â€” Today at 3:31 AM
Actually just the whole concept of "repent and relent"
KnifeWife, resident virgin â€” Today at 3:31 AM
Lot asked God to spare the city if there could be one just person
Cat Enthusiast Merchant (S1AL) â€” Today at 3:31 AM
Abraham
And it was 10
But close
KnifeWife, resident virgin â€” Today at 3:31 AM
My bad
Cat Enthusiast Merchant (S1AL) â€” Today at 3:31 AM
Not bad for a Catholic
:kappa:
MTGloreseeker â€” Today at 3:32 AM
These all sound like examples of just asking papa G nicely, not coercion
KnifeWife, resident virgin â€” Today at 3:32 AM
I'll have to reread
KnifeWife, resident virgin â€” Today at 3:32 AM
Asking a saint to pray for you is also asking nicely and not coercion
MTGloreseeker â€” Today at 3:32 AM
Like, y'all know what coercion is, right?
KnifeWife, resident virgin â€” Today at 3:32 AM
I don't know how coercion got into this at all tbh
MTGloreseeker â€” Today at 3:32 AM
It started here
KnifeWife, resident virgin â€” Today at 3:33 AM
Yeah I don't know how anyone took that seriously
MTGloreseeker â€” Today at 3:33 AM
And now I'm monumentally curious about who, specifically, strongarmed God into doing what they wanted
Cat Enthusiast Merchant (S1AL) â€” Today at 3:33 AM
Stop taking loreseeker seriously
MTGloreseeker â€” Today at 3:33 AM
Or at least who tried to
Cat Enthusiast Merchant (S1AL) â€” Today at 3:33 AM
He is literally just stirring shit for the sake of stirring shit
Because he hates himself and everyone he interacts with
MTGloreseeker â€” Today at 3:34 AM
I'm asking a question you fucking faggot-ass cunt
Tezzereddit â€” Today at 3:34 AM
The attempt itself is the sin
LawyersPlayDota â€” Today at 3:34 AM
this is the key lesson here.
MTGloreseeker â€” Today at 3:34 AM
I asked you a question too, and would have accepted an actual answer but you chose instead to be a vile little faggot about it
LawyersPlayDota â€” Today at 3:34 AM
ðŸ˜‚
melf â€” Today at 3:34 AM

Cat Enthusiast Merchant (S1AL) â€” Today at 3:35 AM
Nobody cares what school of magic it is
KnifeWife, resident virgin â€” Today at 3:35 AM
You're using obvious fake arguments to say that all Catholics are pedos
melf â€” Today at 3:35 AM
so, sorcery is drug use
KnifeWife, resident virgin â€” Today at 3:36 AM
Yeah shit dude you ever seen a nigga on PCP
MTGloreseeker â€” Today at 3:36 AM
I'm arguing that pedophiles (and other problems) lie at the center of Catholicism as an institution
Dumbass
KnifeWife, resident virgin â€” Today at 3:36 AM
Basically sorcery
Tezzereddit â€” Today at 3:36 AM
Taking drugs for spiritual purposes is yeah
Or at least that's the argument.

the pedophilia comes from denying their priests wives
MTGloreseeker â€” Today at 3:37 AM
I care about whether or not you'll actually be a decent human being and either back up your claim or back down from it
I doubt you'll do either
melf â€” Today at 3:38 AM
and telling them they can control their impulses through the sacraments
Tezzereddit â€” Today at 3:38 AM
I don't think celibacy causes pedophilia
That's a bit of a cope
MTGloreseeker â€” Today at 3:38 AM
But I'd like to see you prove me wrong or right, rather than being the typical redditor
Cat Enthusiast Merchant (S1AL) â€” Today at 3:38 AM
Correct. It just helps the pedos hide
MTGloreseeker â€” Today at 3:38 AM
Indeed, they're just evil
KnifeWife, resident virgin â€” Today at 3:38 AM
The pedophilia comes from pedos infiltrating the high ranks and letting others in
As well
